I gained 17.5 hours of freedom a week since [I quited social media](/i-quit). And Iâ€™d like to offer 80% of that time to anyone that wants to talk to me. My domain of expertise goes from launching and bootstrapping online businesses, learning how to code, to working remotely and related subjects. I'm also happy to talk about our life experiences and the things we learned along our way.

So Monday to Friday, [from 7pm to 9pm CET](https://time.is/CET) Iâ€™ll be online on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) (requires a [Gmail](http://gmail.com/) account). I'm open to use any platform of our conviniant, also. 

Here is the link to my calendar, feel free to pick up the day and time that suits you best:
