"Is this method name too short?" "Should I refactor this code?" "How should I fix this bug?" These are the kind of questions that programmers ask themself all the time while writting code.

The great Steve Klabnik propose us to answer these questions using the tools that Philogophy provide us to understand the World. I hope you find it interesting.
