Yes! More than 3 years have been past since my last entry on [Freak Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20140716022021/http://www.freakgroup.com.ar/) and I still remember the wonderful feeling of publishing a new post gave me. 

So it's 2013 and one of the many things I'd like to do this year it's try to get back to _the good habits_ path of the lord. And base on my own experience I find writing very joyful. Will see how it goes. It feels really good to be back ðŸ’•.
