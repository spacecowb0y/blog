> It's probably just a small place
> With a lot of land around it, on a hill
> French garden on the outside, probably big
> Entrance with a gate
> Must be a place of solitude, a mental solitude
> It's an attitude, that I know very well
> But, a physical place?
> 
> Only have one little staircase
> And the typical fountain in the entrance
> Garden extends around the house
> But keep it simple, maybe another fountain on the other side
> Something a bit bigger, but not necessarily huge
> Yeah, like a low fence with a little gate that's never closed
> What a great view
> Enjoy the tranquility
> In the alley for the cypresses that leads to the house
> And then just this vast sort of, uh, horizon
> Gather my senses together in the woods, experience hope
> 
> I keep a dungeon for the darker thoughts
> To cleanse myself, to be able to go downstairs and scream
> I think if there's a s-, if there's a palace in my mind
> It's, it's less sort of a fortress away from the rest of the world
> It's halfway between the world and the stars
> The sounds for the colors, for the possibilities of perception
> Absolute clarity, I know the answers
> You can just get away from everything
> Except for your own thoughts
> Grounded in that entity
> I don't think I would feel alone, because it doesn't really matter
> You have the best view you could possibly imagine
> I think you can see the stars a lot better up there
> You can bend them everywhere
> Somewhere near the event horizon of solitude
> (Absolute tranquility)
> Over the end of every road
> 
> All of the ghosts, people you love
> Even your friends don't want to know
> But you can depend on every note
> Over the end of every road
> 
> But that's a lie
> You actually believe that you have the formula, uh
> And then you see that it is wrong
> Afraid I might become a stranger
> And you'd just be trapped with yourself
> Everything falls apart
