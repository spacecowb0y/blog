## If I get hit by a truck...

…please read this web page.

[digital signature for this page](https://keybase.io/dperalta/pgp_keys.asc)

As this is written in late 2018, I have no reason to doubt that I will be active on the Internet and maintaining my site for another fifty years. On the other hand, I could be hit by a truck tomorrow.

There’s an old joke among programmers about who will maintain the code when its author gets hit by a truck. This page is here so that if for some reason I’m no longer able to keep my web services running, people will know what to do.

I designate [Nicolás](https://twitter.com/nicopace), <s><a href="https://twitter.com/brbrmrcds">Bárbara</a></s> <a href="https://twitter.com/tomasperalta">Tomás</a> and [Marco](https://twitter.com/marcorooter) as my virtual executors to organize such things. (And if you delete anything, I will haunt you from the grave!)

### Media content

All my photos and videos would be inmediatly converted to Creative Commons licence and published on [media.diego.earth](https://media.diego.earth/).

### Source code

Copyright for my GPLed source code should revert to the Free Software Foundation. They seem to have a reasonable policy about letting people use the code. Careful, my code isn’t that good and it belongs an abandoned project probably.

### Website

Please keep the websites operational where possible, with content written by me kept untouched where appropriate. Appropriate pages (e.g. on [blog.diego.earth](https://blog.diego.earth/)) may contain a notice about what happened with a link to more info. The front page of [diego.earth](https://diego.earth) should be redone as appropriate with a link to the old page.

### Grave

I’d like to rest someplace that won’t kill me. That means access to oxygen (although direct access would probably be bad) and not having to climb through six feet of dirt. Could be somewhere close to my hometown, I image a place like [Monte Hermoso](https://goo.gl/maps/MAqtpTtHoDM9fVFf8) or [Sierra de la Ventana](https://goo.gl/maps/3Vt5wAF6wkmXV16CA).

For other stuff, email them. I’m sure they’ll do something reasonable.

If something does happen to me, please update the footer of this page with a link, and switch the Pink's song for [Ruben Rada - Muriendo De Plena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9TqCgA7wZA). Also  set up an autoresponder for my email address to email people who write to me. Feel free to publish things people say about me on the site. These are probably all obvious and I’m sure you’ll figure it out.

Oh, and BTW, I’ll miss you all.
