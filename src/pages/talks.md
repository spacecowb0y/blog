I love to talk about the things I don’t know and I’m yet learning.

## Introducción a CouchDB (ES | 2015)

My very first talk given at the [Meetup.js in Buenos Aires](https://meetupjs.com.ar/) about [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that I used to expriment on various projects during that time.
